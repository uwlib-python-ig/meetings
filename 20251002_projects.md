## Discussion
- Anything you've learned that you want to share?
- What are your Python goals for the 25-26 academic year
- Discussion
-   If I run exactly the same program with the same arguments and inputs, will I get the same outputs? Not "how do I learn what the correct inputs are, etc." For awhile, docker was one of the best ways to do this. If you have a computer, and if you install it and never touch it at all, if you run the program again hopefully it should still work. But that's unrealistic, you don't want to have the same computer. For a long time, install a program on different computers and it should run the same. Docker -- program and program's dependencies and freeze together in an image. Lot of nuance to that, but historically has been JB's answer. Docker image -- could have old, insecure image that you just spin up when needed, will kind of give you the same stuff. In Python, package manager called (UV)[https://github.com/astral-sh/uv]. Really good.
