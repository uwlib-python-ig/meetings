## Discussion
- Anything you've learned that you want to share?
- What are your Python goals for the 25-26 academic year
- Discussion
-   Thinking about last meeting -- using Copilot as a tool to help find certain things. Python with textual analysis as an example.
-   So much about documentation. If there's not good documentation, makes it hard to use or trust.
-   Spirit of experimenting -- taking into consideration damage.
-   Specifics about Special Collections and use of XML and Python to help support the work.
-   Interesting to see it. Could see coming across a grad student who may want to do some of this stuff.
-   TXTDS minor -- interesting to see what can be done. Helpful in developing professionally.
-   Archives Space conversion -- ElementTree, lxml
-   For batch file work, os stat, Python Magic
-   Migration to migration -- some things that are consistent, some things that are different. Even if they're different, what are patterns.
-   Staffweb migration
-     Plone is a Python-based web server. Built on top of Zope. Trying to update it is hard. A lot of work to convert to a different system.
-     Intention is to migrate in bulk from Plone to Confluence. Have to get into the mindset of how Plone "thinks" and how Confluence "thinks" and how to get from one to another. Pulling stuff in almost verbatim to something that you fully understand and control. May need to manually do some stuff. Think about it in stages/steps, multiple smaller programs tends to be better than one big program.
