## Discussion
- Anything you've learned that you want to share?
- What are your Python goals for the 25-26 academic year
- Discussion
-   Thinking about last meeting -- using Copilot as a tool to help find certain things. Python with textual analysis as an example.
-   So much about documentation. If there's not good documentation, makes it hard to use or trust.
-   Spirit of experimenting -- taking into consideration damage.
-   Specifics about Special Collections and use of XML and Python to help support the work.
-   Interesting to see it. Could see coming across a grad student who may want to do some of this stuff.
-   TXTDS minor -- interesting to see what can be done. Helpful in developing professionally.
-   Archives Space conversion -- ElementTree, lxml
-   For batch file work, os stat, Python Magic
-   Migration to migration -- some things that are consistent, some things that are different. Even if they're different, what are patterns.
-   Staffweb migration
-     Plone is a Python-based web server. Built on top of Zope. Trying to update it is hard. A lot of work to convert to a different system.
-     Intention is to migrate in bulk from Plone to Confluence. Have to get into the mindset of how Plone "thinks" and how Confluence "thinks" and how to get from one to another. Pulling stuff in almost verbatim to something that you fully understand and control. May need to manually do some stuff. Think about it in stages/steps, multiple smaller programs tends to be better than one big program.
-     How do you start this? Do you check in with others who are trying to do the same thing? Is there a community about this. Sometimes do this in library work -- see if someone else has the same problem.
-     Yes, started looking for people who have worked on this, other tools. Was able to find a few people who had examples of unrestricted search results. Found a couple of scripts where people got a part of this going.
-     Scary to be using stuff that no one else is using. Seems like it's bad exposure. Bespoke or not being used anymore. Institutional risk?
-     Want to manage value, cost, and risk -- don't want the risk to be super high. Plone is still used (esp in Germany), but not common. When moved from Plone to Wordpress for website, opened up a lot of options to get further support/commercial solutions.
- Idea: iSchool capstone, creating a wiki site. Media Wiki has web dev tools. Want to create it for labor history. Entries about local unions, individuals, organizations, etc. Would have to have a clear scope. Try to pull historical notes from finding aids. Pull data from wikipedia, other sources as well. Encyclopedia about it. API tools for Media Wiki. Something could do, need to figure out how to do it.
-   Might be possible to [download a copy of wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download), then have it locally on computer.
-   Disambiguation could be a challenge.
-   You may have seen this too but check out [hosting options](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Hosting_services) if you want to run a wiki
- Class: have to research places on campus. Going to give tour to someplace on campus. PCAD has had to migrate a few times. Is that in a stable place? Will we have to migrate it again?
