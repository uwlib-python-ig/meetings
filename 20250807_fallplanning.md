## Discussion
- Anything you've learned that you want to share?
- What are your Python goals for the 25-26 academic year?
- Discussion: student who wants to do textual analysis. Has heard about AI, considering that. ES is recommending using Python. Have to articulate what you want to do pretty specifically. Hard to go from "this would be cool" to "this would be easy-ish to do in Python." JB: can use Copilot for finding Python libraries for tasks (ex. textual analysis). Data science in the humanities class that used Python -- telling the class how to do something and seeing it play out in a Jupyter notebook. Don't know why or how doing it. Question of it was even useful. Was it scientific, reproducible? Ex. sentiment analysis -- does it mean anything? With Python, having a clear problem statement is helpful.
- When learning a new Python library:
-   Can I get it to work at all? Use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). uv handles codependencies in libraries. 
-   NLTK module
-   """ -- long string that you may want to work on, and the string may have quotes in it. Use triple quotes when string has quotation mark in it.
