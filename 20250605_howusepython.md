## Announcements
> - Introductions if time and number of participants permits, else please say hello in chat!
> - Started a [list of potential speakers](https://hackmd.io/-s08LbKmRq2kbKzXJmSZLw?both) that can be edited by anyone. Please add to the list! 

## Discussion
- What problems do you use Python to solve? What are you hoping to get out of this class?
-   Interested in learning from others. Want to learn how to do basic textual analysis with Python. Stuff that's useful, not just a magic trick. Is this a presentation place? Maybe a place where we discuss projects that we're working on? Getting feedback on projects?
-   Interested in the Libraries being able to use Python more so to have more power or agency. A lot of times, get to a certain point and you're stuck and need an IT person. Like with Excel, if you know formulas you can do it on your own without having to get someone else involved. When it comes to programming, can be intense. Have been programming a long time, really love programming. Have been a teacher for different languages. Happy to talk about whatever is useful. General things that have found useful are: if people have a problem where Python could maybe solve the problem, that could be useful. A lot of times people have problems getting started -- first steps is sometimes useful. Happy to talk about problems have solved with Python or am working on solving:
-   Special Collections: has a bunch of finding aids. ArchivesWest is a way to render XML finding aids. ArchivesSpace -- internal tool to track accesssions. Those files ideally can be connected to the finding aids, but historically haven't done that. Attempt a few years ago to port into ArchivesSpace, not be edited directly -- but that did not work. Unfortunately, in order to manage these XML files, SC uses Access databases (call Java, XML translations, etc.), and we need to update to Windows 11. Hired someone to work on this problem again. Wrote a series of scripts in Python to try and deal with this problem. They download the list of stuff in ArchivesWest, the list of stuff in ArchivesSpace, create an Excel file to mark files that need to be marked with a 1, and a script runs overnight, addresses those, uploads back to ArchivesSpace, reports problems. One thing that Python can be really good at is one time migrations. When you write code that is going to have to keep running for years, you have to be careful -- it's easy to write that code, but your job has changed. Python has a lot of libraries to be able to interact with different data formats. When you have manually created XML, you have a bunch of weird stuff. Files not converting properly -- code was looking for text, child element had text, but code didn't go through the child elements so it was difficult to identify. One of the best Python functions is breakpoint -- when Python program gets to that point, it stops. Can interact with the program at that point and it helps.
-   When first trying to solve a problem with Python, first ask if there's a library that does this. If in a new problem that don't know a lot about, try to use Google or Copilot to ask if there's a library that already exists that does this. Useful to use Copilot/AI tool if you don't know the language that's used. Will then search it and try to find the actual documentation.
-   Python packages for web queries: requests. Concept of a session in a request. If you create a session, that's where your login info is. requests-cache: has some settings. monkey patching -- you go into somebody's code and change it, they didn't design for you to change but that's what it does. If you query a certain URL with that info it will check a cache and if you've queried it recently it'll give you a cached request.
-   When using AI -- how accurate do you need it to be?
