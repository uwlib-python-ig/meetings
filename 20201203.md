## Agenda:
### 1. Will the PIG create or adopt a community agreement or other document to provide best practices for our meetings? Some options:
- Adopt [a modified version](https://hackmd.io/@ries07/Byc87tecD) of the UW Libraries Digital Scholarship Collective's community agreement
- Create our own community agreement, based on the DS Collective's work, or based on something else, or something completely original and unlike any community agreement ever known
- Do nothing
- Do something else?

#### Discussion
- 100% of attendees agreed to adopt our slightly-modified version of the DS Collective's community agreement for the time being
- This will be included in the [meetings repository README](https://github.com/uw-libraries-python-interest-group/meetings/blob/main/README.md)

### 2. What are members interested in hearing about during the upcoming presentation from Vishwa Pardeshi, UW Libraries Text Mining Student Specialist?
- Vishwa kindly shared a link to [some past projects](https://github.com/vishwapardeshi) so we could take a look and indicate what we are interested in hearing about
- Alternately, of course, we could just ask to hear about the work overall, and see where the discussion goes from there! 
- And don't forget to fill out the [Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/poll/ng7pff7kdi5xmytf?utm_source=poll&utm_medium=link) so we can set an alternate time and day for the meeting (it would otherwise fall on Dec. 24)

#### Discussion
- Ben and Melissa looked at Vishwa's projects and we are interested in hearing about the [Text_Classification_US_Presidential_Nominees_2020](https://github.com/vishwapardeshi/Text_Classification_US_Presidential_Nominees_2020) project
