## Discussion
- Possible uses for Python: studying how sentences have changed (length, word selection, how they start and end). "Absolute phrases." Back in the 70s, very popular -- free modifier. Possible personal project in English Studies.
- Parsing out metadata. How many characters, parse that out. See when certain things start.
- Have been using Python quite a bit -- [API calls to do bulk edits and uploading to IA](https://archive.org/developers/internetarchive/). DataCite API to do bulk creation of APIs. Made life easier! IA API takes hours. [DataCite Bulk DOI Creator](https://github.com/gsu-library/datacite-bulk-doi-creator/blob/master/README.md)
- [Study session 3](https://github.com/uwlib-python-ig/shared-01/tree/main/walsh-book-study-group)
