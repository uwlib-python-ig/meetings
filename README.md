Notes from University of Washington Libraries Python Interest Group \(UWL-PIG\) meetings

## Community Agreement

The UWL-PIG provides opportunities to learn about the Python programming language by inviting individuals and groups to present on their work.

To support our learning community, we have adopted a community agreement originally developed by the UW Libraries' Digital Scholarship Collective:

### As a group, we:

* Are sensitive to the needs of others
* Give mutual respect, particularly when folks are making themselves and their work vulnerable
* Actively listen and engage with fellow group participants
* Recognize the intelligence and expertise in the group
* Acknowledge when we don't know something
* Value people over tools
* Seek lightness, collegiality, and humor
* Are flexible, as we acknowledge that our values and needs may change over time
